        a brief on my being
    </h1>
    <p>
        I enjoy stopping to think about code mathematically and critically, and I am passionate 
        about writing it! When I'm not tangled in the weeds of STEM, I enjoy writing satire, reading 
        Dostoevsky, and listening: to people, post-punk, and philosophy podcasts.

        Since May this year, I have been working with a group of scientists in the Applied Physics and 
        Math department at Columbia, developing software to manipulate large databases, and researching 
        an area of data science I had never before heard of - ‘spectral topological data analysis’. 
        Naturally, there was a lot of learning on the job: navigating the initial struggles of learning 
        Git, working in a team to brainstorm and build a full-stack web app in a month, and picking away 
        at how I can use the data structures I learnt in class to speed up tedious grant burn 
        computations. The combination of research, interaction, and creativity involved inspired my 
        excitement for building software tools that impact people’s lives.

        This excitement is propelled by my appreciation for the theoretical underpinnings of computer 
        science – math! I first stumbled upon computational geometry in high school, and continued my 
        research in the subject into college. Slicing and packing problems accelerate the gears in my brain. 
        In addition, independently reading about and giving talks on probability theory taught me 
        how to communicate technical things to an audience, a skill I will use as I design and give 
        workshops on machine learning, UI/UX design, web development, and more to underrepresented 
        students in tech with the non-profit Superposition. More generally, reading about topics in 
        discrete math fuels my energy to make something concrete out of them – such as the gambler’s 
        ruin game I am building now based on simple random walks!

        Finally, for me, coding is not a purely objective, sequential process – but rather the act of
        contending with a living creature that demands my subjective interference. Developing products 
        for people has challenged me to think critically about design and utility with my audience in 
        mind, a mode of rigorous questioning is something I have internalised through over 8 years of 
        debate, an activity I thoroughly enjoy!
