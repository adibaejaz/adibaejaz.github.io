                I'm a first-year PhD student in the causal AI lab at Columbia University, where I'm advised by the wonderful <a href='https://causalai.net/'>Elias Bareinboim</a>. I'm interested in the interface between theoretical computer science and 'causality', broadly construed. This spans algorithms for causal inference, algebraic statistics, and causal decision theory.

            <p>
                I recently graduated with a bachelor's in math and computer science (also from Columbia), during which I was fortunate to work with  <a href="https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/christos-papadimitriou">Christos Papadimitriou</a> and <a href="https://thebillingegroup.com/simon-billinge/">Simon Billinge</a>.

            I love teaching. As an undergraduate, I TA'd for
            <ul>
                <li>COMS 4236 Computational Complexity (Fall 2022 with Xi Chen, Spring 2023 with Rocco Servedio)</li>
                <li>MATH 4041 Modern Algebra I (Fall 2020 with Robert Friedman, Spring 2022 with Jorge Pineiro)</li>
                <li>MATH 1208 Honors Mathematics B (Spring 2021 with Evan Warner)</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            I've also organised seminars in algorithmic game theory (Summer 2021) and the formal semantics of programming languages (Fall 2022) with the <a href="https://theory.cs.columbia.edu/undergrad-tcs-seminar/index.html">undergraduate TCS seminar</a> at Columbia; 
            and taught philosophy to high-schoolers in New York through <a href="https://corrupttheyouth.org/">Corrupt the Youth</a>.

                I'm also very into the philosophy of math, Urdu poetry, and music made in New York through the 60's and 70's.
